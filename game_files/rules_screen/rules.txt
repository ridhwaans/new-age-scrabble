Score points by creating words from the seven tiles on the rack and placing them on the board.
Words can run from left to right or top to bottom but not diagonally.
The first word covered must cover the star at the center of the board. Other wrods must use at least one tile already on the board.
The rack is refilled to seven tiles after each play as long as there are sufficient tiles left in the bag.

Scoring: 
The number on each tile indicates the point value for that tile.
When placed on the board the total points of all new words formed by the tiles are added to the score of the player.
