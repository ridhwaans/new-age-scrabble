DMR-Softworks Corporation has introduced a digital video game variant of Scrabble™ that pits the user against an AI opponent. New-Age Scrabble can be played on either a PC or a mobile Android device; the game will allow the users to test their abilities by facing an AI challenger. We anticipate that the digital version will provide new challenges for players and ease of use for newcomers, while still retaining the classic feel and entertainment value of the original game.
